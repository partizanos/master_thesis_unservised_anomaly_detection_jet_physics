# master_thesis_unservised_anomaly_detection_jet_physics

In this thesis a set of techniques is explored in the problem of separating experimental Physics Jets (phenomenological signatures of particle decays in LHC detectors)  . 
Momenta kinematics and energy are used for the tagging (unsuepervised classification).
The experiments present various classical machine learning Anomaly detection techniques (kNN, One Class SVM, Gaussian Mixture models, Isolation forest)
as well as hybrid models combining artificial neural network autoencoder models in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
